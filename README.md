To get the background for the problem, watch 
this short video first:

I'm intersted in this problem because: 

- Nobody has been able to solve it 
- It seeems like a very hard problem 
- I learn about managing complexity
- I learn mathematical computing

I'm also interested in the option that 33
should not be on the list of numbers that can be 
a sum of three cubes. And how to prove it.
