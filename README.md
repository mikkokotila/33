## the unsolved problem of 33

To get the background for the problem, watch 
this short video first:

I'm intersted in this problem because: 

- Nobody has been able to solve it 
- It seeems like a very hard problem 
- I learn about managing complexity
- I learn mathematical computing

I'm also interested in the option that 33 should 
not be on the list of numbers that can be a sum 
of three cubes. And how to prove it. 

### 33.sh

To run the script, you need to have the input file 
where you have the cubes you want to check against. 

INPUT FILE: 33.input

You will also end up with an output file, where you
can find the results. 

OUTPUT FILE: 33.output
